A bunch of sexy math topics covered by sexy math textbooks for those studying in a field neighbouring math, such as CS and will never be thought these topics by their uni.

> My reason for creating this repo is that I do not feel I get enough exposure to the fun side of math as a CS major and so I want to explore as much on my own as possible. There is also a folder for uploading any interesting self-written articles btw! 

All in all math rules or I should say:

``` java
System.out.print("CS is o(Math)")
```
